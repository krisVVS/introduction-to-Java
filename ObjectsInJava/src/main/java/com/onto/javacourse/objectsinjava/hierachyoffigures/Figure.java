/**
 * Abstract class representing a geometric figure.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Figure} class is the base for all figure types such as {@code Point},
 * {@code Line}, {@code Rectangle}, and {@code Square}. It serves as a common parent class
 * for all specific figures but does not define any properties or methods itself.
 * </p>
 *
 * This class allows for polymorphism, where different figure types can be treated
